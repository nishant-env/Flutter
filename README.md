1. Using basic knowledge of flutter widgets and stepping one step ahead, I utilized stateful widget and gained a little knowledge on        streams and stream controllers and constructed a login screen that does authentication but only on local level using regular expressions, not on real API.
2. Created another Login Screen although both screens looks similar, they somehow have got a different approach of implementing data handling. Here, instead of constructing a stateful Widget, rather a simpler Stateless Widget was taken into action. A bloc Class was constructed which contained all the getters for stream data flow. Rxdart package was also taken into action instead of dart native streams, in order to simplify our task.
